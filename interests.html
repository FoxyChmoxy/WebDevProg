                                    <p>I started playing chess when I was 12 years old. But I got my first discharge at the age of 18. I was never seriously interested in chess, but I was always interested in playing it. This game makes me move my brain and look for various ways out of the situation.</p>
                                    <p>I even remember how once losing to my classmate, I took revenge from him two days later. I won because I studied openings and tactics all these two days.</p>

                                    <p>My favorite programming language is <b>Python</b>, and most of all I like (or rather, the most that I can) it is to create web applications. It doesn’t matter backend or frontend.</p>
                                    <p>My favorite pastime in programming is finding the right and best algorithm for solving the problem. In the near future I want to participate in competitions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest">ICPC</a>, and prove myself there.</p>

                                    <p>I only got a love for theater when I entered university. There were days when I attended theaters more than movie theaters.</p>
                                    <p>I was always disappointed with only one thing: the performances are not released as often as I would like. Most of all I like to listen to opera, I have a special attitude towards them, and least of all I like ballet.</p>
                                    <p>In the season when the poster appears, I always book tickets in advance on the <a href="http://www.gatob.kz/en/posetitelyu/repertuar/#tab29">Gatob.kz</a> and I visit the theater once a week every Saturday evening.</p>
                                    <p>I also like to hang out in a cafe after the theater to fully taste all this aroma of a serene and inactive, but cultural holiday.</p>
